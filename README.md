JankyCat 
============

JankyCat is a Arduino/Processing based setup that can send text messages over 
Ethernet to be displayed on an LED matrix. There is no reason why *anyone* 
should use it. The Sender end is a GUI in Procesing using the [ControlP5] 
(https://github.com/sojamo/controlp5) library. The Receiver is an Arduino board 
controlling an LED matrix using the 
[Parola](https://github.com/MajicDesigns/MD_Parola) library
